<p>Flowers, closely arranged along a tall woody bloom stalk, are each
formed by 6 petals and sepals (perianth segments) surrounding a large
fleshy pistil. The 3 outer segments often have mahogany brown shading
on the back, the 3 inner are creamy white, or greenish white. They look like
drooping bells in the daytime, but spread to a total width of 3 to 4 inches
when fully open in late evening. Pollination is accomplished only by the
deliberate work of a <i>Pronuba</i> moth. Total height of plant, including blossom
stalk, is about 4 feet; leaves narrow, stiff and yellowish green, with a
sharp spine at tip. Grows on plains, particularly in sandy areas, and extends
into foothills. Blooms June-July.</p>

<p>The generous acceptance of the first seven numbers of
MUSEUM PICTORIAL convinced the Trustees of the
Denver Museum of Natural History that the publication
is filling a definite need in the field of natural history reports.
The subjects are so varied that a wealth of material
is available.</p>
<p>The present issue is the first printed in color, and
will, we hope, be followed by others. The authors, Harold
and Rhoda Roberts, probably are the foremost photographers
of wild flowers of Colorado and the Southwest. This field
work has carried them from the tops of the highest mountains
of Colorado to the depths of Death Valley. Their outstanding
Kodachrome slides have been shown to many audiences and
have appeared in publications. It is hoped that Museum
Pictorial No. 8 will be the first of a series on Colorado wild
flowers by the authors, which may eventually be compiled
into book form.</p>
<p>Harold Roberts, prominent Denver attorney, is a
Trustee of the Museum, and chairman of its Building
Committee.</p>

<p class="tb">The purpose of this booklet is to portray a few of the common
wildflowers of Colorado in such form that they may be recognized and
their names learned without the use of any botanical key. The color plates
here published show fifty different flowering plants, each of which grows
in abundance in some part of this state. Most of them are found also in
other areas, particularly in the Rocky Mountain states. With the description
of each plant, some reference is made to the life zone in which it grows,
but no attempt is made to give the geographical extent of its range. In
every instance the photograph reproduced was taken on Kodachrome film
of a living plant in its natural setting. All of them are shown in full bloom
as we see them in Spring or Summer, except milkweed, <a href="#Page_43">page 43</a>, and cattail,
<a href="#Page_66">back cover</a>. These appear in seed as we find them along the roadsides in
October.</p>
<p>The flowers are here arranged in substantially the order that the
families to which they belong appear in most botany manuals. Some
references to these plant families, and to the genera and species into which
they are subdivided, will be found on <a href="#Page_57">page 57</a>. With each plant we have
given the common name most familiar to us. As there is little uniformity
in common name usage, others may know them by other names. We have
added in each case, in italics, the Latin botanical name, with abbreviated
identification of the botanist first using that name. The English form of
the family name is also given. We have tried to select flowers representing
as many plant families as possible, and among them to cover plants from
different altitudes and from different types of soil and growing conditions.</p>
<p>Some of these photographs were taken at close range, with a long
focal length lens, to show on a large scale the beauty of very small flowers.
Others were taken with different equipment so as to include the form of
the complete plant and show plainly its natural setting. In all cases the
size of the flower and of the entire plant are given in or may be inferred
from the descriptive text. The figures used are approximate, and considerable
variation from these sizes will be found. The colors are as
accurate as colorfilm and high class press work can make them.</p>
<p>The pictures here reproduced were all taken by the authors within
the past twelve years. Most of the plants were found within a few hundred
feet of some well traveled road. A few of the pictures were taken in
adjoining states, but in every such instance the species shown is found in
the same sort of environment in Colorado. Many of these flowers are
reproduced as part of the setting in habitat life groups in the Denver
Museum of Natural History. Look for them there, and also get acquainted
with them in their native haunts. They add decided interest to outdoor
ramblings.</p>

<p>Climate, which is a composite of prevailing temperature, length of
season and average moisture, is the chief factor in deciding where plants of
any given species can grow and propagate. Soil type also plays a part,
and if extremely unfavorable may totally exclude some species of plants
from a large and otherwise favorable area, but in general, soil is the minor
factor. In Colorado, climate is largely determined by altitude, so here, as
we pass from one elevation to another, we find plant life arranged in
horizontal layers or zones of the sort illustrated in the above sketch. The
thinness of air, in the sense of less oxygen per cubic foot of air, that goes
with high elevation, seems in itself to have little effect on plant life, but
the prevailing cold, the long period of snow cover, and the increase in
annual precipitation, that go with elevation in our mountains, do have a
profound influence on plant growth. High latitude has much the same
effect as high altitude, so that the timberline conditions we find in Colorado
at from 11,000 to 12,000-foot elevations are very similar to those existing
at sea level near the Arctic Circle. Growing conditions, and prevailing
plant species, at these widely separated places, are, for this reason, much
alike.</p>
<p>These zones of life have no sharp boundaries, but tend to intergrade
into each other. Many species of plants normally inhabit parts of two or
more zones, and local conditions may so influence climate that particular
species of plants will be found growing at lower elevations, or at higher,
in one part of the state than in another. Generally, however, in Colorado
like elevations result in plant populations of quite similar makeup, even
though a whole range of mountains or a deep wide valley may lie between.
The principal factor causing exceptions to this rule is the tendency of many
areas in western Colorado, particularly those between about 6,000 and
10,000 feet in elevation, to receive greater average annual precipitation
than is received by corresponding areas east of the Continental Divide. As
a result of this, many species which in eastern Colorado occur only in
moderately high elevations will be found clear down in the foothills in
western sections.</p>
<p>The individual life zones of Colorado are illustrated and described
on the next five pages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">PLAINS</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p00a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="786" height="533" />
</div>
<p>All of Colorado lying east of the base of the mountains, as well as
large areas in western Colorado lying along the course of the Colorado
River and its main tributaries, are within the life zone commonly known
as the Plains, and referred to in technical books as Upper Sonoran. These
areas are mainly below 5500 feet in elevation, and are relatively flat. Clay
soils are the rule, with local sandy spots. The rainfall throughout this zone
is scanty and irrigation essential to general farming. These conditions have
restricted the native vegetation throughout this zone to species which can
tolerate long periods of drought, and thrive on sunshine with heat in
summer and cold in winter. A surprising number of species of flowering
plants live and thrive on these very conditions. We rarely find them in
colorful masses, single plants or small colonies being the rule.</p>
<p>Originally native grasses covered this zone with a fairly tight sod,
broken, however, by windblown patches and cut by arroyos. Live streams
were far apart. Trees were absent except for cottonwoods and a few box
elders along water courses. Settlement has brought roads, ditches, cultivated
fields and a large amount of livestock. These acts of man have made life
hard for some native flowers, but for most species, living opportunity has
been increased. The plains are flowerless only for those who fail to pause
and search.</p>
<p>The detailed growth patterns or specialized mechanisms by which
the various plains flowers resist drought, and so get a chance to live, are
numerous. In general they do one or more of these things: rush through
a short individual life cycle from seed to seed so timed that the new seed
crop is set before the heat of summer is far advanced; conserve the limited
moisture their roots gather by having few leaves and defending them from
animals by thorns or toughness; or, spend a large part of every year,
especially the dry, hot months, as a dormant bulb or buried root stock.</p>
<p>The picture at the top of this page shows a plains area just at the
base of the foothills near Denver. It looks barren, but many species of
flowers can be found there in May and June.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">FOOTHILLS</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p00b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="769" height="533" />
</div>
<p>Long strips of land from 5500 to 8000 feet in elevation lying
between the plains and the mountains, and filling in with rough hills and
valleys the spaces between mountain ranges, comprise a life zone known
as the Foothills, and named, by naturalists, the Transition zone. In this zone
much of the soil is filled with gravel and weathered rock detritus washed
down from higher land or left there by ancient glaciers. Total annual rainfall
in this zone is higher than on the plains, and the broken character of
the land gives protection from storms.</p>
<p>A greater number of species of flowering plants can be found in
this zone than in any other single zone. Local conditions of soil, water and
sun exposure vary widely, and these variations offer favorable living
conditions to different types of flowering plants and to the numerous shrubs
that grow here. Many species of wild flowers which grow on the plains
extend into the lower parts of this zone, while other species found in the
higher mountains reach down into it, especially along streams.</p>
<p>The chief native trees of this zone are yellow pine and, along streams,
narrow leaf cottonwood. Scrub oak covers many hillsides with dense
growth, junipers are locally plentiful, and aspens reach down from higher
elevations. This tree population attains forest proportions only here and
there so that open places for wild flowers are abundant.</p>
<p>In Colorado, visible spring comes earlier in this zone than on the
plains below. Sheltered slopes facing the sun pick up the earliest flush
of spring green, and by the end of March the very first flowers may
here be found in bloom. Late April, May and early June bring the main
flower crop. Mass color effects may then be found such as several acres
blue with Larkspur, or a whole hillside dotted with red clumps of Lambert&rsquo;s
Loco. The main show is over by mid-July, though asters and sunflower-like
composites keep the roadsides colorful till frost.</p>
<p>The picture at the top of this page shows a foothills area near Golden.
In good years these hills are rich in flowers by early May. A half hour walk
then will frequently yield 30 species or more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">MONTANE</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p00c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="799" height="512" />
</div>
<p>The great mid-sections of our high mountains, lying between 8,000
and 10,000 feet in elevation, make up a life zone called Montane, also
known as Canadian. Since most of our Colorado mountains are granite,
the typical soils in this zone are granite gravel. Some mountains, however,
are faulted blocks of sedimentary rock which have weathered into clay and
sand soils. The annual rainfall in this zone is over double that of our plains.
This has resulted in forests of lodgepole pine, aspens, and of several species
of spruce, with stream banks lined with willows and water birch.</p>
<p>This abundance of vegetation has produced enough humus to build
rich black soil in the bottoms of the narrow valleys. In this zone grow a
wealth of flowering plants. The principal adverse conditions against which
they struggle for existence are: a fairly short season from spring melt to
fall freeze; and more tree shade and more competition from tree and shrub
roots than they would choose. The steep hillsides in this zone may be quite
rock covered. Between the rocks small amounts of good soil may form,
and under loose rocks moisture stays for a long time. Trees thrive on
these hillsides, but in open spots and beside rocky outcrops flowers get
their chance. The columbine grows in perfection in this zone, extending
downward into the foothills and upward to timberline.</p>
<p>The building of highways in our mountain areas has introduced new
conditions of which some plants are quick to take advantage. The stirred-up
soil of new road fills and drainage channel construction will be colorful with
fireweed, purple fringe, brown-eyed-susans, with here and there penstemons
and asters by the second or third season of their use. Local irrigation accomplished
by highway drainage and the use of snowplows, as well as distribution
of seeds by animals and even by cars that use the roads, all play their
part in this quick restoration of life in the soil that has been torn up.</p>
<p>The picture at the top of this page was taken near Mary&rsquo;s Lake in
Estes Park. The mountain shown is Twin Sisters. Its slopes are a fine
hunting ground for flowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">SUB-ALPINE</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p00d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="750" height="543" />
</div>
<p>Above 10,000 feet the pattern of life changes. Until timberline
is reached at about 11,500 feet, this band of mountain country is called the
Sub-Alpine or Hudsonian life zone. Soil and moisture conditions are almost
as favorable as in the lower montane zone, but here the snows of winter
stay late, especially on north slopes, and frost may come even in mid-summer.
The race to ripen seed, before winter comes, is intense, and the seeds, when
produced and scattered, face special problems of germination and survival.</p>
<p>The trees of this zone are largely Engelmann spruce, limber pine and
alpine fir. Some thick forest stands exist, but the main pattern is small
compact tree groups&mdash;one or more big seed-trees surrounded by younger
offspring&mdash;with open patches of grass between. Perennial flowering plants,
springing from woody root-crowns have special advantages here, though
some annuals thrive, especially if they can get started in the fall and remain
dormant under snow till spring. Melting snows in May, June and early July
give natural irrigation to large areas of this zone. Competition with sedges
and grasses and ability to stand light frost are problems for the plants that
live here. Many typical alpine plants of the next higher zone work down
into these sub-alpine meadows.</p>
<p>The picture at the top of this page was taken just west of the Poudre
Lakes in Rocky Mountain National Park. Lake Irene is in the foreground.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">ALPINE</span></h2>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>From timberline (about 11,500 feet) up to our highest Colorado
mountain summit (Mt. Elbert 14,431 feet) climate is too severe for any
trees. This condition marks these areas off as a separate life zone called
Alpine or Arctic. Soil forms only slowly on these rocky summits, but mosses,
lichens, sedges and grasses have been here for ages of time, all of them
patiently building humus. Erosion carries less soil away from the tops
than it does from the lower hillsides. So in the spaces between the barren
looking rocks, good soil exists, and water, though mainly falling as snow, and
not quite as heavily as in the sub-alpine zone below, is adequate for plants.
Here grasses, sedges, a few dwarf shrubs and herbaceous plants have all
the sunlight to themselves without tree competition. The ever-present
adverse condition is low temperature, frequently with strong wind.</p>
<p>It is a land of tough dwarf things. Perennials are the rule, though
annuals are found. Low woody mats with basal leaves and flowers only
a few inches high are a common pattern. Bulbs and tubers wedge themselves
between rocks, out of reach of ground squirrels, if possible. When
spring comes with a rush, usually late in June, these dormant plants burst
into life in the days of longest sunshine. Shoots of new growth erupt
from the ground with buds all formed ready to open. By the end of July
the seed crop is largely mature, and by mid-August the browns and crimsons
of fall colors in leaves and grasses spread a Persian carpet over these heights.
Warm days from then till winter are days of germination for newly scattered
seeds and, for established plants, preparation of buds for next year.</p>
<p>It is in this zone of harsh living conditions that some individual plants
probably attain greater age than is normally reached by plants of the lower
life zones. We know of no statistical study to support this statement, but
observation of mats of moss campion, or of tufts of alpine spring beauty,
or of scarred old crowns of alpine forget-me-not, indicates that they have
safely survived the snow cover of a great many alpine winters.</p>
<p>The view at the top of this page is from Trail Ridge in Rocky
Mountain National Park. Longs Peak is in the distance. In mid-July these
foreground slopes are a garden of alpine flowers.</p>

</div>
<p>Flower is an inch in diameter, of 6 petals and sepals all alike (perianth
segments) united at their base into a tube over an inch long. Several of
these rise from the buried crown of the plant, as do also the leaves, &#8540; inch
wide and over 6 inches long, resembling heavy curved blades of grass. The
matted, cordlike roots store, through the long dormant period, the starches
and sugars needed for rapid Spring growth. Grows in sandy soil in plains
or low foothills. Blooms April-May.</p>
<p>When sand lilies begin to dot the gray plains with their singularly
pure white stars we can know that the season of growth and color is
returning. We called them Mayflowers and hoped they would be in bloom
for May-baskets. They usually were&mdash;along with Johnny-jump-ups (little
yellow violets) and sprays of pepper and salt parsley. To pluck them
one by one and suck the drop of nectar from the long white tube is one
of the delights of childhood. The plants are crowded with flowers during
the blooming season, but, when it is over, disappear completely from the
scene.</p>

</div>
<p>The flower, of flaring trumpet shape 3 inches in diameter, is formed
of 6 petals and sepals, all alike, (perianth segments) tapering at both ends.
Color varies from rose-red to red-orange. Stem 15 to 30 inches high,
bearing a single flower (occasionally 2 or more) and several whorls of
leaves, comes from a round bulb. Picking the flower usually kills the bulb.
Grows in rich soil in partial shade near streams, montane zone. Blooms July.</p>
<p>This is one of the most sought-after and breathtaking of our mountain
flowers. It used to grow in abundance, then almost disappeared due
to excessive picking. Now it is returning in secluded sylvan places. It
prefers moist, shady banks where its brilliant color lights the shadows like
a flame. The young flowers, with their big dark anthers, are the brightest.
As they fade, the anthers shrink and turn dull orange and the flower has
a tendency to become spotty. If you have the good luck to find these lilies,
stop and enjoy them in their woodsy background&mdash;but do not pick any to
take home.</p>

</div>
<p>Flower, more than 1 inch in diameter, is formed of 3 perianth segments,
which are narrow, greenish and sepal-like, and 3 segments which
are broad, showy and petal-like. On the inner surface of these latter, near
the base, are large, hairy glands of dark color. Stem is slender, 8 to 20 inches
tall, with few linear leaves, and comes from a deeply buried corm. Grows
in fairly heavy clay soils on open grassy slopes in foothills and lower montane
zones. Blooms June-July.</p>
<p>The name mariposa recalls to us the high flat tableland of Mesa
Verde with thousands of these delicate lilies floating above the other flowers
like butterflies, as the Spanish name implies. Our species is one of the most
beautiful, with its tall stem and subtle coloring resembling a small white
tulip with grass-like leaves. Other species are creamy, yellow, orange, pink,
lavender, gray; some of them quite small, with pointed hairy petals. Journeys
to many interesting places will go with a search for the mariposa in its
infinite variety of color, shape and habitat.</p>

<p>Flowers, 1&frac12; inches across of 6 bright gold perianth segments, all
alike and strongly re-curved, nod, singly or in twos or even threes, at the
top of a naked scape which rises from the deep-seated bulb. The 6 stamens,
each tipped with a large yellow anther, surround a prominent green style
and hang downward. Plant is about 10 inches high, with only two broad
green leaves which sheath the base of the scape. Grows in sub-alpine zone
extending through montane zone. Occurs only on the west side of the
Continental Divide (except for a few limited areas immediately on the east
side). Blooms immediately after snow melts, which is June in high places.</p>
<p>Below the snowbanks on Mt. Audubon, near Thunder Lake in
Rocky Mountain National Park, on slopes near Rabbit Ears Pass, and in
many places on the western side of the range, early summer brings one of
the finest flower shows in the west, which it is no exaggeration to call the
&ldquo;field of the cloth of gold.&rdquo; The glacier lily (also called avalanche or snow
lily&mdash;or, oddly enough&mdash;the dogtooth violet) begins to bloom right at the
foot of snow banks and follows the retreating ice up the mountainsides.
We have seen acres where it was hard to walk without stepping on several
plants, particularly in the northern mountains of Wyoming and Montana.</p>

<p>Flower, usually solitary, is shaped like a Dutch shoe about 2 inches

with greenish sheen, the other 2 petals, much narrower, extend to the sides
and are often twisted and streaked with brown. Plant is about 10 inches
tall, with broad lance-shaped green leaves which enclose the lower part of
the flower stem. Grows on moist but not wet slopes in montane zone. June.</p>
<p>In not too open aspen glades in middle elevations, a privileged seeker
after beauty may find this yellow lady&rsquo;s slipper, largest of our native orchids.
It is one of several species of <i>Cypripedium</i> (the name meaning shoe of
Venus) and is sometimes called moccasin flower. A smaller, daintier
orchid, the pink <i>Calypso bulbosa</i>, is more widely known. This latter likes
half sunny edges of our lodgepole forests, being quite dependent on the
humic acid of the needles. Often in large groups along the remnants of a
decayed tree trunk, they make an entrancing sight, resembling fairy dancers.
These are but two of about a dozen orchids that grow wild in Colorado.</p>

<p>Individual flowers are formed of a slender calyx tube, 1 inch long,
flaring at its mouth into 5 white, petal-like lobes to make a tiny salver
&frac14; inch across. They have no true petals. Numerous such flowers are
clustered to form the surface of a ball about 2 inches in diameter. Plant
has reddish stems, somewhat hairy, that creep on the ground, with fleshy
(succulent) green leaves arranged in opposite pairs. Grows in plains on
sandy soil. Blooms May-June.</p>
<p>Every plains child knows the prairie snowball&mdash;inhabitant of vacant
lots in towns, and of dry wind blown flats &ldquo;in the country.&rdquo; The cluster of
starry flowers is indeed round as a snowball and as white&mdash;the dark green
leaves are in sharp contrast with the bright red stems. The fragrance, almost
cloying it is so sweet, perfumes the air of early summer, especially as evening
coolness comes. The reddish-purple sand verbena of the southwestern

<p>Numerous flowers, each formed of 6 minute yellow perianth segments,
are grouped in round tight clusters at the ends of slender pedicels,
several such clusters radiating to form a flat-topped head (umbel) 4 inches
across. These heads are borne on erect hairy leafless stems (scapes), 8 to
15 inches tall. Oblong leaves about 1&frac12; inches long, form a green mat on
the ground. Grows on open dry slopes of foothills and lower mountains.
Blooms June-September.</p>
<p>Many Species of <i>Eriogonum</i> are found in Colorado, some of them
resembling the one pictured, and some with very different growth habits.
This common sulphur flower is one of the finest. Even in bud it is brilliant,
for the gold of its flowers, often touched with red, shows before it is quite
open. The soft sulphur yellow of the mature flowers gradually changes to
shades of orange, maroon and brown as they dry rather than fade. They
linger on their stems indefinitely and are fine to mix with grasses and seed
pods for a fall bouquet&mdash;they might even trim an autumn hat!</p>

dock, is usually an ugly one, as it seems to choose the poorest soil it can
find, the cinders beside a railroad track&mdash;or the gravelly edge of a country
road. No one notices the small, insignificant flower, but its hour of glory
comes with the brilliant rose and red seed vanes that call out gaily to every
passerby. In the plains of western Colorado another dock, <i>Rumex hymenosepalus</i>,
is also spectacular growing to a height of 2 feet or more with a
great column of rose-colored seed vanes.</p>

<p>Flower is &frac12; inch across of 5 pale rose-colored petals, notched at the
end and with veins of darker shade. Sepals are only 2; plant is 6 inches
or less in height, with succulent stems and rather broad lance-shaped leaves
which rise almost as high as the loose raceme of 3 or more flowers. Grows
in rich soil montane and foothill zones. Blooms immediately after snow
melts which is late May to July, or much earlier on warm slopes.</p>
<p>The plants of this species that grow in foothill locations often have
quite bright rosy color. They are great favorites, as their first blooms hint
that winter is nearly over and spring on the way. They have been reported
as early as January, and by mid-March they are often abundant under
scrub oaks on sunny foothill slopes. The east side of the Hogsback near
Golden is a good place to find early ones. The plant pictured above has the
pale color and general growth habit of those that grow high in the montane
zone. It often forms a carpet or ground cover of pale pink bloom in the
fields of glacier lilies. Another species, <i>Claytonia megarhiza</i>, has a big
root, to store food and moisture, and grows in the alpine zone. We have
found plants of it on the big flat summit of Pikes Peak where other signs
of spring are few.</p>

<p>Flowers, &#8540; inch across, of 5 bright purplish-red petals, notched at
the end, spread from the top of a tubular calyx so that the whole
flower forms a tiny salver. Stems and leaves are so dwarfed and tightly
grouped as to give the appearance of a cushion of green moss 3 to 8 inches
across, studded with little reddish stars. Grows in alpine rocky areas extending
to peak summits. Blooms late June-early July.</p>
<p>This is one of the alpine flowers we share with all the alpine and
arctic lands of the Northern Hemisphere. High mountain ridges are its
home here, and if we travel north we keep finding it at progressively lower
elevations until it reaches the low barren lands of the arctic. Always it is
where winds are cold and climate is too rough for trees. You might take
it for a pad of green moss if it were not for its red flowers, often in the
form of a circlet near the plant&rsquo;s edge. Close examination shows a full-fledged
plant, however, with leaves, stems and a stout tap-root well buried
in what soil there is below and around the rock it presses against. Another
member of the pink family that grows as a mat against our timberline
rocks is sandwort, <i>Arenaria sajanensis</i>. Its flowers are white, and the plant
less densely compacted. Related to both of these alpine pinks are the
numerous chickweeds of foothills and mountains. They have low slender
stems and their petals are white and deeply notched at the end.</p>

<p>Flowers, of 5 to 7 petal-like sepals, form a wide cup 1&frac12; inches
across, white or pale lavender within, and much darker lavender to purple,
covered with silky hairs, on the outside. The numerous golden stamens are
prominent. The flower buds, quite furry at this stage, spring directly from
a buried root crown before the green leaves, divided into several lobes,
appear. Grows in foothills, especially on gentle north slopes where extra
snow has drifted. Blooms late March-April.</p>
<p>It goes also by the name of wind-flower, and often is called anemone.
Whatever name you choose, it is one of the best-loved flowers of the Rockies.
They are with us in March, going on into April, coming up through late
snows&mdash;keeping themselves warm with their furs about them. The flowers
start on short stems, but the whole plant grows quite large and &ldquo;leggy&rdquo;
as the season advances, and finally the fluffy seed plumes offer their wares
to every breeze. This same pasque flower is the state flower of South
Dakota. A northern species, growing in Glacier Park and in Canada,
<i>Pulsatilla occidentalis</i>, has larger flowers, of a creamy color. Its cluster of
seed plumes is large and dense enough to resemble a dish mop.</p>

<p>Flower, &frac34; inch in diameter, of 5 to 9 showy petal-like sepals, usually
deep red, occasionally yellow, forms a shallow cup around the numerous
stamens and a conspicuous group of pistils which, after the flower fades,
become a round thimble-shaped seed cluster. The pedicels, bearing the
solitary flowers at their tips, are several inches long and covered with silky
hairs. Plant is about 1 foot tall, with subdivided leaves near the base and
on the sparingly branched stems. Grows in partial shade in montane zone.
Blooms June-July.</p>
<p>This globe anemone, related to the better known pasque flower, is
one of the many less conspicuous plants that add to the charm of a flowery
hillside, yet reserve their more delicate beauty for those who take time to
prowl. This particular specimen was found in a glade filled with columbines.
We would probably not have seen it if we had not stopped to try one more
columbine picture! <i>Anemone canadensis</i> is a somewhat larger plant with
pure white flowers, rather woody stems and deep green foliage. It grows
in shady places along foothill streams, but only where conditions are to
its liking. In these spots it forms rather dense colonies.</p>

<p>Flowers, &frac12; inch or more wide, are formed of 5 showy, dark blue,
irregularly shaped sepals, enclosing at their base 4 much smaller petals of
lighter color. The uppermost sepal extends backward as a slender spur
&frac12; inch or more in length. About a dozen flowers on slender pedicels
group around a central erect stem to form a loose raceme which often nods
slightly at the top. Plant is 10 to 15 inches tall and bears rather few leaves
each sub-divided into linear segments. Grows in foothills zone. Blooms
late April to early June.</p>
<p>This small larkspur of the early spring looks much like the single
larkspur of an old-fashioned garden. Its favorite location is near the base
of a clump of scrub oak where a little snow has drifted in the winter giving
that spot a bit of extra water. The intense blue of these flowers contrasts
well with the leather brown color of last season&rsquo;s oak leaves. When spring
is farther advanced other taller larkspurs, such as <i>Delphinium geyeri</i>, called
poison-weed by the stockmen, make a more spectacular showing on low

<p>Flowers are an inch across, formed of several (3 to 15) broad, overlapping
golden petals having the glossy sheen of butter. The sparse leaves
are divided into linear lobes. These and the succulent stems grow a few
inches tall, breaking out of frosty soil with flower bud ready to open. Grows
on alpine and sub-alpine slopes near snow banks. Blooms when snow melts,
usually June to early July.</p>
<p>The hardiness of the snow buttercup is its outstanding characteristic.
It comes up through the snow because in the high altitude in which it lives
its time for fruition is short. It pushes a stout knuckle of stem through the
snow crust, attracting the sun&rsquo;s heat by the dark color of its stem, then the
knuckle straightens, lifting the already formed bud into an erect position.
The bud opens rapidly and proceeds to spread out in the hole caused by
melting. Of the many glossy members of the buttercup family, there are
few of so rich a yellow, or which give such an appearance of being all flower
with inconsiderable leaf and stem.</p>

<p>Flower is 1&frac14; inches across of 5 to 10 (or more) pale cream petal-like
sepals, with numerous yellow stamens and several pistils in the center.
Numerous petals, so dwarfed as hardly to be noticed, surround the base

several flowers, each on its own slender stem. Leaves are dark green and
deeply cut into 5 or more spreading lobes (palmate). Grows in moist rich
soil in sub-alpine and alpine zones. Blooms late May-July.</p>
<p>When the snowbanks melt in the alpine country, hundreds of
temporary runlets carry the snow water to timberline lakes and to permanent
streams. In the wet soil along these runlets and near these lakes, globeflower
is one of the common and very good looking plants. Both its
foliage and its flowers are graceful and charming. Associated with it is
usually marsh marigold, <i>Caltha rotundifolia</i>, which is also a member of the
buttercup family. Our Colorado marsh marigold is not gold at all, but
white&mdash;even a bluish-white. It grows with its feet right in the water. Its
leaves are entire and are all at the base of the sturdy low plant. Its flowers
are as large or slightly larger than those of globeflower. It makes an effective

<p>The flower is formed of 5 sepals and 5 petals, alternately arranged

forming a wide saucer-like star 3 inches across; the petals form a white inner
cup 1&frac34; inches across, and stretch back between the sepals as hollow, slender
2-inch spurs. Plants are 2 feet or more high of several delicate stems, usually
carrying at their tops numerous flowers. The deeply cut leaves are mainly
concentrated at the plant base. Grows in rich soil in montane zone, but
extends into foothills and up to timberline. Blooms June-July.</p>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s queenly state flower speaks for itself much more eloquently
than humans can speak for it. No portrait can do it justice. We
have found it in the very glade near Palmer Lake where James first saw
it and named it <i>coerulea</i> for its celestial blue. We have found it in countless
aspen groves of the montane zone and finally on rocky scree near timberline
(a more compact plant there&mdash;with flowers sometimes white or
of a rosy hue). Always there is the thrill of real discovery&mdash;a new

foothills and lower montane zones. Blooms May-September.</p>
<p>These big coarse plants, which may be seen in small groups along
our roads at culvert ends and in neglected fence rows, could be taken for

big circles of white crepe paper with a center of spun gold. As the season

<p>Individual flowers are &frac14; inch or less across, each with 5 white

circle of oblong, leathery leaves. As the blossoms age, the flower cluster
becomes loose and sprangly. Grows on moist slopes in sub-alpine and montane
zones. Blooms May-July.</p>
<p>Saxifrage is another large family of quite varied sorts. Gooseberries
and mock orange come within its membership. The numerous species of alum
root, <i>Heuchera</i>, are also included, as are many little alpine and sub-alpine
plants that grow out of rock crevices in our high mountains. Purple saxifrage,
<i>Saxifraga jamesii</i>, with quite large red-purple flowers, and dotted saxifrage,
<i>Saxifraga austromontana</i>, with tiny white flowers covered with pale dots,
are among the best. All of these seem able to thrive on only a teaspoonful
of soil in a rock crack, if only there is local moisture. The structural features
that bring all these plants within one family are not obvious. The leaves of
many of them are similar to the leaves of a gooseberry bush, though in some

<p>This thornless yellow rose is one of the most widespread and most
ornamental shrubs of mountain areas. Individual clumps are rarely fully

fresh blossoms, groups of faded petals, and small, dry, fuzzy seeds (achenes)
distributed over the plant. Other species of <i>Potentilla</i> grow also in our

resemblance to a yellow single rose, and the absence of thorns are common

alpine neighbor, <i>Trifolium dasyphyllum</i>, which closely resembles the white
clover of our lawns, though with touches on its petals of red-brown. In

The banner bends back slightly and carries markings of lighter color near

form a narrow keel. Numerous flowers, attached at the calyx base along
the upper third of a naked stem, form a showy spike 10 inches or more

<p>The many members of the pea family going by the names of loco,
vetch, milk vetch, etc., are usually considered crass weeds and are in disrepute

<p>Flowers are brilliant scarlet, 2&frac12; inches across, with a conspicuous
group of green stigmas in the center. Plant is a single, erect, cylindrical,
dark-green joint or stem about 5 inches high, several to many of which
often group closely together forming a mound. The stems are strongly
ridged and carry sharp spines in clusters. Grows in rocky or gravelly soil
on plains and into foothills, southwestern Colorado. Blooms May.</p>
<p>This is related to some larger <i>cacti</i> that grow in Arizona, and
there get the name of hedgehog. The name pincushion is broadly used for
all the small round <i>cacti</i> of our area even though they are not too closely
related to each other. The bright, strawberry-red flowers of the plant shown
above quite set it apart from the pincushions of eastern Colorado plains.
Among these are hen-and-chickens cactus, <i>Echinocereus vividiflorus</i>, with
small, greenish-yellow flowers, also, spiny stars, <i>Coryphantha vivipara</i>, a
round little cactus with shiny purple flowers. These plants are so like the
prairie sod in color as to defy search when not in bloom. Ball cactus,
<i>Pediocactus simpsonii</i>, of foothills and montane zones, is quite a perfect
globe in shape, 3 to 6 inches in diameter, and has small pink flowers closely
grouped at the top of the globe.</p>

<p>Flowers are 3 inches or more across, usually light-yellow with fine
sheen, several of them erupting from the edge of a flat, oval joint. Plant
spreads over a circular area, about 2 feet in diameter, and is made up of
numerous connected flat joints, of light-green color, all heavily armored
with pale, sharp spines, some of which, in old plants, may be flexible and
hair-like. Grows on clay soil in foothills and plains of middle and western
Colorado. Blooms June-early July.</p>
<p>Several species of Opuntia closely resemble each other. Some of
them, including a few found in Colorado, bear soft, juicy fruits which are
quite good eating when the prickles on the skins are removed, so all of
them are called prickly pear. The one shown above grows freely on the
high grassy flats of the San Luis Valley. It bears dry, hard fruits, as do
most of our Colorado species. The prickly pears, like all the other cacti,
accumulate moisture, when they get a chance, in the soft pulp of their
round or jointed stems. Then, over periods of drought, this moisture is
used to produce flowers, to mature seeds and to keep the plant alive. The
whole plant shrinks visibly if the times between drinks are long. But for
the defensive armor of their spines, few of them would survive, because
in a thirsty land every hungry cow is looking for moisture too.</p>

<p>Flowers are cadmium-yellow, fading old-rose, 2&frac12; inches across, of
4 wide petals. The 4 narrow sepals bend back and at their base merge into
a hollow tubular stem. The style branches at its tip into 4 conspicuous
slender stigmas. Plant has little or no main stem; leaves are dark-green, strap-shaped,
3 inches long. Grows in foothills, but only where soil is somewhat
marly. Blooms May-June.</p>
<p>Look for this one of our numerous evening-primroses about Memorial
Day. Soil formed from the disintegration of Niobrara shale such as we

its preference. The plants are rather ragged, but the flowers draw all our
attention to their soft, clear yellow as they spread open in the sunshine.
They last but a day&mdash;fading into soft rosy colors. The white members

that the whole flower cluster (inflorescence) is a loose raceme forming the
top foot or more of a tall leafy shoot, several of which rise from a woody
root crown. Leaves are narrow, 2 inches or more in length. The entire

<p>Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary describes fireweed as &ldquo;any of several weeds,
troublesome in clearings or burned districts.&rdquo; To use &ldquo;troublesome&rdquo; in
connection with this great &ldquo;willow-herb&rdquo; of the Rockies seems most unkind.
We are grateful to have it rush into devastated areas to cover scars with
its bright pink to magenta blossoms. The whole plant reddens as it ages.
The flower matures into a long thin pod which splits and curls releasing
feathery seed carriers. A less common low growing species with larger

with saw-toothed edges, arranged in whorls along the woody stems,
but most numerous at the base of the plant. Grows in moist acid soil under
pine or spruce trees in montane zone. Blooms late July-August.</p>
<p>The members of the heath family like shade, acid soil and moisture.
These conditions they find in the woods of the Northwest, where a great
variety of them, including rhododendrons and azaleas, grow in abundance.
Colorado has its share of the smaller heaths for those who look for them
in shady spots and along mossy trails near mountain streams. The trail to
Calypso Falls in Rocky Mountain National Park is good hunting, not only

<p>Individual flowers, almost &frac12; inch across, are formed of 5 brilliant,
crimson, spreading corolla lobes which join at their base into a narrow tube;
dark shadings and yellow markings at the throat of the tube give the effect

Grows in sub-alpine zone or slightly higher. Blooms June-early July.</p>
<p>This spectacular primrose grows at the edge of cold streams, or
often on rocky-mossy hillocks right in mid-stream. One never forgets the
picture of their beauty&mdash;the flower clusters so rich in color, the alpine
background, the mat of moss and deep green leaves. Too bad for such a
plant to spoil any part of it with a most disagreeable fragrance, yet that
does remove any temptation to take them home. On the higher tundras,

narrow, petals or corolla lobes which flare outward and backward, but
unite at their base into a short tube. From this tube 5 conspicuous anthers,
over &frac14; inch long, grouped together like a sharp straight beak, protrude
forward. Ten or more flowers, each on a slender pedicel, nod in a cluster

mat of dark-green, oblong leaves. Grows along streams and in wet meadows,
in montane and sub-alpine zones. Blooms June-early July.</p>
<p>Both the coloring and the shape of this little flower are fancy indeed.
It is small wonder that such names as shooting-star and bird-bill have been
given it. The crimson of its petals contrasts strongly with its conspicuous
almost black &ldquo;bill,&rdquo; and between these colors is a little circlet of white,
often shaded with yellow markings. A whole meadow of such flowers is
a sight well worth a trip to South Park, or to other of our high meadow

plant along country roads, often dust covered, yet with flowers of fine
delicate color and real charm whether we examine them singly or fix our
attention on the compact cluster in which they grow. As autumn comes
the dry leaves do not drop, but cling to the stem, rattling in the wind. The
rough seed pods, often four inches long, turn a rich brown, and finally split

In details of flower structure, as well as in size, they vary considerably. All

Sunflowers are familiar examples. Throughout some genera of this great
family, and in various species of additional genera, the rays are totally
absent. Rabbit brush is one of the composites whose flower heads have
no rays. They are showy only because so many of them cluster together,

<img src="images/p19a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="589" />
</div>
<p>Flower heads, 2 inches across, are formed of about 30 white rays,
slightly striated and indented at the tips, surrounding a disc, about &frac34; inch
in diameter, of numerous tubular gold-colored florets. Plant is about 3
inches high and carries one or several flower heads right on the top of a
spreading tough root crown from which also rise numerous, narrow, linear
leaves about 2-3 inches long. Grows on grassy plains, and foothills. Blooms
April-May.</p>
<p>These are among the very earliest of the plains flowers. Their typical
occurrence is as isolated plants, one here and one there between grass turfs
in areas of rather tight prairie sod. They are so low and compact that they
are not easy to find, even though their beauty well justifies the search.
Spring has come when Easter daisies are out, even though the plains are
still clad in winter gray with only a faint suggestion that in time the range
will be green. Several other members of this daisylike genus are found
in the foothills and plains. One of the commoner of these, <i>Townsendia
eximia</i>, is easily distinguished by its short spreading branches which carry
a few leaves.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="579" />
</div>
<p>Flower head, 1&frac12; inches across, is composed of about 200 narrow
rays of brilliant lavender color, surrounding a button-like center &frac12; inch
in diameter, of numerous, bright-gold, tubular florets packed closely together.
Plant is 1&frac12; to 3 feet high, freely branching, with numerous flower heads;
leaves oblong or oval 2-3 inches long. Grows in shady places, rich moist
soil, montane and sub-alpine zones. Blooms late July-September.</p>
<p>As the season advances, these aster-like flowers become the most
conspicuous color notes in our high-altitude aspen groves. They come after
early flowers are gone and bloom with a profusion unknown to most shade-loving
plants. Before they too are gone a leaf here and there on the
geranium plants in these same places will have turned bright red; on the
ground, ivory colored puff-balls will be ready to discharge their clouds of
brown spores, and the very first of the aspen leaves will have turned yellow
and be drifting down. Showy fleabanes may linger to catch the first fall
snows. Another of the many members of this genus, <i>Erigeron trifidus</i>,
grows on the plains and brings out its small white blossoms in late April
when it may catch the last spring snows.</p>

<br /><b class="sc">Alpine Sunflower,</b> <i>Hymenoxys grandiflora</i>, <span class="smaller">PARKER</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p20a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="600" />
</div>
<p>Flower head is 3 to 4 inches across, the central disk, an inch in
diameter, made up of over a hundred tiny, tubular, golden florets, surrounded
by about 30 bright yellow rays which are flat and notched at the
outer end. Plant is 5 to 15 inches tall of one or several woolly stems, with
leaves divided into several narrow lobes. Grows on alpine slopes. June-July.</p>
<p>This woolly-stemmed, dwarf sunflower, sometimes called old-man-of-the-mountains,
or sun-god, is a startling surprise for the newcomer to
our above-timberline tundras. One expects smaller more timid flowers here,
and so at first the big bright faces of these plants seem out of place. Then
we come to love them for their gay defiance of tough growing conditions
and think of them as the proper guardians of high windy places. Whole
colonies of them will be found with all the flower heads faced in the same
direction. This will be a direction from which they receive strong light,
and is a form of heliotropism. The stems, however, do not twist through
a full half circle each day to follow the sun.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="605" height="800" />
</div>
<p>Flower heads, 1&frac12; to 2 inches broad, are solitary at the ends of
stems and branches, and made up of numerous (100 or more) rose-colored,
tubular florets fluffing out widely at their tops and grouped tightly together
at their bases into an involucre made of many little, overlapping green
bracts. Plant is about 3 feet tall with gray-green deeply cut leaves; stem
and leaf ribs armed with prickles. Grows on plains, extending into foothills.
Blooms May-September.</p>
<p>Thistles of some sort are found in all parts of Colorado. Above
timberline they take on grotesque shapes. In one, high-altitude thistle,
<i>Circium hookerianum</i>, the whole woolly top of the plant, formed of compressed
leaves and inconspicuous flower heads, bends over to resemble the
head and neck of some shaggy animal. In our sub-alpine hay meadows a
different species, <i>Circium drummondii</i>, may spread flat on the ground with
no main stem and keep its flower heads so low that the mowing machine
goes right over it catching only tops of a few leaves. On the plains are other
species with shaving-brush-like flower heads. In spite of the prickles on their
leaves and stems, horses nip off the flower heads and eat them with relish.
Donkeys and mules seem to like them even better.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS</span></h2>
<p>All plants are related to each other in the sense that every one of
them is descended from a common primitive uni-cellular life form which
came into existence on this planet millions of years ago. As the remote
progeny of that ancestral cell, or group of cells, became scattered over the
earth and faced diverse conditions, which in turn changed with the ages,
these millions of related organisms exhibited profound changes such that
the differences in form, size and structure have become more noticeable
than are the badges of common inheritance. This is the process called
Evolution. Changes are established so slowly, however, that the immediate
descendants of any particular plant, or the offspring from cross-pollination
within a closely related group, will continue for many generations to be
substantially identical in structure with the parents. As long as substantial
identity in structure exists, all of these individual plants form a single
&ldquo;species.&rdquo; As these species are discovered, botanists give each of them a
Latin name. Within Colorado over 2000 such separate species of flowering
plants are known. Minute variations such as color of petals or degree of
hairiness of leaf or stem are treated as &ldquo;varieties&rdquo; within the species.</p>
<p>Many thousands of these substantially identical plants may be found
scattered over parts of a state, or over several states, or even throughout a
life zone area comprising parts of several continents. Within the life zone
favorable to them, the only geographical limits seem to be those affecting
distribution of live seed.</p>
<p>In the search for plants, many different species are found, either
in the same or more often in different localities, in which the resemblances
are close; in fact many parts are almost identical, but persistent differences
are also present. A common ancestor several hundred or several thousand
years back may have existed, but evolutionary changes have brought noticeable
differences in the respective descendant groups. If the changes are not
too great, especially if the mechanisms of reproduction have not been so
greatly changed as to make cross-pollination totally impossible between
plants of the several species, these related species, wherever they may have
been found, are said to comprise a &ldquo;genus.&rdquo; To this, also, a Latin name is
given. <i>Lillium</i>, for example, is the generic name of all true lilies everywhere;
<i>umbellatum</i>, however, is the specific name of the group to which our Colorado
mountain lily belongs; and &ldquo;<i>Lillium umbellatum</i>&rdquo; is the full name of
the plant shown on <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>.</p>
<p>Still greater differences in plant and flower structure are found,
coupled, however, with strong resemblances in significant parts of the
structure. This has led to grouping a considerable number of genera
together into a &ldquo;family.&rdquo; Latin names also are given to the families. For
these names there are, in most cases, well established English equivalents
which we have used here without repeating the more technical family name.
Within each family all genera and each species of every genus will exhibit
strong resemblances in the mechanism of seed production, and the general
pattern of the organs of reproduction will be recognizably similar. For
example, all species in the rose family (with very few exceptions) have
numerous stamens arranged in whorls; they also have a calyx formed of
five sepals joined together at the base.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Other groupings, such as &ldquo;Orders&rdquo; comprised of several families,
or &ldquo;tribes&rdquo; composed of several genera within a family, are used by botanists,
but for the purposes of this booklet we have used only the names of families,
genera and species.</p>
<p>To the amateur one of the most interesting phases of plant classification
is the way in which, as we pass from one life zone to another, or
from one part of the state to another part within the same life zone, we
find that a plant species which we have observed at one spot, is replaced, at
another, by a different species within the same genus. We find our white
mariposa, <i>Calochortus gunnisonii</i>, on the east side of the mountains, then,
in flat clay plains in southwestern Colorado, we find the sego lily,
Calochortus nuttallii, which is a similar, but quite distinct mariposa with
cream-colored petals and a crooked, much shorter stem. Beyond the
boundaries of Colorado numerous other species of Calochortus are found,
all of them different from ours, but all of them quite obviously mariposas.</p>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">HOW PLANT POPULATIONS MAINTAIN THEMSELVES AND SPREAD</span></h2>
<p>Infant mortality is high and life expectancy short among the flowering
plants. They not only struggle against extremes of climate, but they
are the primary food of the animal kingdom, and so pursued by creatures
that have the advantages of sight and locomotion. It is only by marvelous
fecundity and by ingenious devices for seed dispersal that plants maintain
their position on the earth.</p>
<p>The first objective of every plant is to produce fertile seed in as
large a quantity as the supplies of food and moisture and the length of
season will permit. Pollination, which brings about the merging of the
male and female cells, is essential to seed production. The majority of
plants combine in a single flower stamens which carry in anthers on their
tips the male element pollen and one or more pistils which hold at their
base ovaries containing the female cells. These ovaries are reached by the
pollen through the style and the stigma at its tip. The flower may thus
fertilize itself in most species, but cross-pollination from other plants of the
same species makes for more vigorous stock. The showy petals and petal-like
sepals, which draw our eyes to flowers, make the flower conspicuous also
to bees, moths, and even birds which act as pollen bearers. Other lures to
this same end are fragrances and nectar. The detailed mechanisms by
which the various plants increase the likelihood of cross-fertilization, within
the brief period that any given set of cells is capable of fertilization, are
numerous indeed and a fascinating study.</p>
<p>In most plants, seed develops and becomes fully ripe in a matter of
weeks after fertilization has occurred. It is also commonplace for a single
flower to produce a seed pod or other fruit which may contain hundreds of
separate perfect seeds.</p>
<p>The next step is to scatter this seed over an area wide enough to reduce
the risk of all of them perishing at once, and also wide enough to keep the
survivors from competing too closely with each other for soil, moisture
and sunlight. Here again fascinating devices come into play. Building each
seed with a plume or bit of fluff at its tip so that it can be carried far by
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
wind, is one of the commonest tricks. Other seeds float easily on water and
so reach new sites. Other seeds invite being eaten by birds or beasts, and
depend upon a fraction of them either being carelessly dropped before
being swallowed, or having tough enough shells to resist digestion. Quite
a number of plants produce seed pods which, when they become thoroughly
dry split open with a jerk flipping seeds over distances of several feet.
Finally there are the various burs and barbed seeds that are carried for miles
by animals and by man.</p>
<p>Seeds thus become scattered over the earth, and so numerous and
efficient are the devices of dispersion that in the course of years the seeds
from a single plant colony, and from the successive new outlying colonies
it founds, may become spread over miles of distance. Only a few barriers
completely stop such spreading. Oceans, high mountains and broad deserts
are the most effective barriers, but even they do not always stop every
seed of every plant.</p>
<p>This spread of seeds pays little attention to life zone limits, or to
such interference as rivers, hills or local barren areas may present. Over
and past all of such minor obstacles the flow of seed rolls.</p>
<p>The final problem for the seed is how to germinate and become
established in the place it lands. If that place is totally unsuitable for the
particular species, the answer there is failure. Many seeds may invade a
locality too dry for their development. In such a case, even if germination
occurs, all such seedlings will die before a single plant matures. Heavy
frost may act as a like absolute veto to other seedlings that venture too high
in altitude or too far north in latitude for their own limitations. By forces
such as these, each species of plant stays contained within limits beyond
which it cannot become established, even though individual seeds may in
great numbers invade impossible localities.</p>
<p>Mature plants may tolerate conditions which wipe out all tender
seedlings of the same species. This leads to interesting patterns of plant
distribution in semi-desert areas, such as occur in parts of Colorado. Once
or twice in a century a series of two, three, or even five successive years
may occur when the soil is moist and extraordinarily favorable to plant
growth throughout weeks or months of the spring and summer. In these
special times seeds that have invaded a usually hostile area may, if they have
retained fertility, germinate, push their roots deep, and become so vigorous
that when normal dry years follow these particular plants live on and thrive
for the remainder of their lives, even though their own seeds fall on barren
ground and the species maintains only a precarious or temporary foothold
in the area.</p>
<p>Governed by forces such as these, and limited by competition with
each other, plant species have for ages taken their places in the global
economy and carried out their part of the commandment to be fruitful
and multiply. Otherwise we and the animals we prey upon could not exist.</p>

<p>The flower spike forms the top 6 to 10 inches of a stiff rush-like
stem which rises from a sheath of long, narrow, flat leaves to a total height
of about 4 feet, the leaves rising slightly higher than the stem. The top 3
or 4 inches of the flower spike is composed of numerous male flowers
producing only pollen and early dropping off to leave a bare, rather sharp,
stem tip; the lower 4 or 5 inches of the flower spike is composed of thousands
of female flowers packed so tightly together as to give the appearance
of a smooth, rich-brown cylinder, more than an inch in diameter, which
finally breaks up into fluffy seeds. Forms solid colonies in marshy places
in plains, foothills and lower montane zones. Blooms first appear about
July, and become mature in September-October.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
